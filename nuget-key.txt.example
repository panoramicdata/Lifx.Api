# This is an example file. Create a file named 'nuget-key.txt' with your actual NuGet API key.
# 
# To get your NuGet API key:
# 1. Go to https://www.nuget.org/account/apikeys
# 2. Create a new API key with "Push" permissions for the Lifx.Api package
# 3. Copy the key and paste it into nuget-key.txt (without this comment)
#
# The nuget-key.txt file is .gitignored for security.
#
# Example format (your key will be different):
# oy2abc123def456ghi789jkl012mno345pqr678stu901vwx234yz
